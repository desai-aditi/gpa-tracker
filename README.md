- **Interactive Sliders:** User-friendly sliders to easily adjust grades for each course, providing a dynamic and intuitive way to interact with the application.

- **Current / Target Mode:** Users can switch between modes to lock current grades and set target grades alongside each course. This feature prevents accidental changes to current grades.
